# About the project

The project provides a clothing detection model written in Python using TensorFlow and Matplotlib libraries. The model also uses Keras dataset, which provides tens of thousands images used as samples to train the model. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

In order to use this model, you need to install the following: 

* Python 3.*

* TensorFlow library.

* Matplotlib library.

* NumPy library. 

* An IDE capable of graph plotting, such as PyCharm Professional.


### Installation

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), at least 3.0 release.


2. Clone the repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/marcin9898/Clothing-detection.git
```

3. Install TensorFlow library.

```
pip install tensorflow
```

4. Install Matplotlib library.

```
pip install matplotlib
```

4. Install NumPy library.

```
pip install numpy
```

Happy days, you are ready to run the model.
